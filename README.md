# Outcomes based on Goal
![goals](Outcomes%20based%20on%20Goal.png)
Setting a goal of less than $5,000 is the most successful Play Kick Starters amongst all. Attaining this goal leads to a success rate of over 72%. $35,000 to $44,999 has a success rate of over 65%. Goals of $20,000 to $34,999 and more than $45,000 have a success rate of less than 50%, with $45,000 to $49,999 having a 0% success rate. I would focus on the lower amount goals as they bring the most success. 

	
	
  
# Outcomes based on launch dates
![Date](Outcomes%20based%20on%20launch%20dates.png)
May is the most amount of success for starting the Theater Kick Starter campaigns.So starting in May would be beneficial and increase chances of success. June and July have the second and third most successful Kick Starter campaigns out of the remaining months. So Summer is probably the best time. The winter months are the worst months to start a Kick Starter campaign. People are most likely saving and spending for the holidays including Christmas and are less likely to spend money on a Kick Starter campaign.
